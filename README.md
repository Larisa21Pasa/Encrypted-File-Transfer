# Encrypted-File-Transfer
## Project Overview

The project aims to develop a distributed system to facilitate communication between stations, with a focus on the secure transmission of encrypted messages and files. The core objective of this project is to provide a robust and secure solution for information exchange within a distributed environment. The system seeks to create a safe and efficient framework for interaction among various entities involved.

## System Features:

### Communication Protocol:

Utilizes sockets to enable reliable, bidirectional communication between stations.
Employs the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to ensure correct and ordered data delivery, guaranteeing data integrity.

### Encryption:

Implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to secure transmitted messages and files.
Ensures data confidentiality in transit and protects against unauthorized access.

### Security Goals:

Provides a secure communication environment where stations can interact effectively.
Maintains data confidentiality and integrity throughout the communication process.

!!! This is a team project developed during the 4th year of the Automatics and Computers program. !!!

### My contributions to the project development include:

Creating a Python library with AES-128 encryption.

Writing documentation.

Simulating communication between separate stations for transmitting encrypted messages.
